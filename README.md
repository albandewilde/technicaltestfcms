## Server

The server listen on the adress `0.0.0.0:8254`.

### Start the server

There is two way to start the server, natively with Go or in a container with Docker.

To run the server natively use the command `make run`. You'll need to have at least Go 1.17 installed.

To run the server in a container use the command `make ctn-run`. You'll need to have docker installed.

### API

#### Route `/alert/`

##### Method `POST`

Ex:  
Http `POST` request with url `/alert/` and body:

#### Route `/alerts/`
